===========================
       Wolf & Amanda
===========================
















They chose the river because no one else ever did.
It cut through Appalachia like a secret—cold, fast, fed by rain and mountain runoff, its banks choked with ferns and fallen trees. No roads close. No camps. Just water over stone and the sound of it moving like it had somewhere important to be.
Amanda checked the treeline out of habit. Old instincts. Old fears.
Wolf was already unbuckling her gear.
“You’re thinking too much,” Wolf said, toeing off her boots. “Nothing hunts here.”
Amanda raised a brow. “You say that like you aren’t something people warn children about.”
Wolf grinned, sharp and delighted, and pulled her shirt over her head.
Amanda watched—openly, unashamed. Wolf’s body was all scars and strength, muscle earned the hard way, skin marked by a world that tried and failed to kill her. Moonlight slid over her like it recognized her.
Wolf stepped into the river without hesitation, gasping once at the cold before laughing—a real laugh, loud and reckless.
“Come on, Amanda,” she called. “The water doesn’t care who you used to be.”
That did it.
Amanda stripped more slowly, folding her clothes like the river might judge her if she didn’t. When she finally stepped in, the cold stole her breath, shock blooming up her legs.
Wolf was there instantly, hands steadying her, eyes bright.
“Got you,” she murmured.
They waded deeper until the water curled around their waists, then their ribs. The current tugged, insistent, alive. Amanda leaned into Wolf without thinking, fingers curling at her hips.
For a moment, they just stood there—bare, vulnerable, utterly unarmored in a world that demanded armor.
Wolf dipped under first, resurfacing with water slicking her hair back, eyes wild and joyful. She shook like an actual wolf, spraying droplets everywhere.
Amanda laughed despite herself. “You’re impossible.”
Wolf moved closer, waterline brushing Amanda’s collarbone. “You followed me into a river at night. Don’t pretend you’re sensible.”
They floated for a while, letting the current carry them a few lazy feet downstream before grabbing a rock or each other to stay close. Amanda lay back against Wolf’s chest, the river rushing past, the sky wide and uncaring above them.
For once, Amanda wasn’t thinking about who might be watching.
Wolf rested her chin on Amanda’s shoulder, breath warm against her skin. “This is what freedom feels like,” she said quietly. “No walls. No rules.”
Amanda closed her eyes.
No systems. No flags. No ghosts demanding loyalty.
Just cold water, a living world, and the steady presence of someone who chose her every day.
When they finally climbed back onto the bank, shivering and laughing, Amanda pressed a kiss to Wolf’s damp shoulder—brief, tender, full of promise.
The river kept moving.
But they stayed. 

===========================

Amanda’s house was… wrong.

That wasn’t a criticism. Wolf understood wrong. The wasteland was full of it. But this wrong was deliberate—clean lines scavenged from pre-war ruins, furniture rebuilt with symmetry instead of necessity, walls scrubbed until the metal panels almost shone.

Modern.

Amanda liked it that way. She said it helped her think.

Wolf stood in the living room, hands on her hips, turning slowly as if the place might bite her if she stopped paying attention. No pelts. No bones. No shadows that meant anything. The silence felt exposed.

“So,” Wolf said at last, hoisting the first head—an impressively preserved radstag—onto her shoulder. “Needs something.”

Amanda looked up from arranging a shelf of books and holotapes. Her smile faltered immediately.

“Oh no.”

“It’s tasteful,” Wolf insisted. “Classic. Makes the walls feel… watched.”

“That is exactly the problem,” Amanda said, crossing the room in three brisk steps. “Nothing needs to watch us. This house is allowed to be neutral.”

Wolf frowned. “Houses should know who lives in them.”

Amanda gently took the radstag head from Wolf’s hands like one might remove a live grenade. “This house knows,” she said. “It knows we survived. It doesn’t need reminders of teeth.”

Wolf gestured broadly. “I brought options.”

Amanda followed her gaze—and groaned.

Leaning against the wall were three more mounts: a yao guai, a mutant hound, and something that might once have been a very unlucky opossum.

“No,” Amanda said flatly.

Wolf’s ears metaphorically drooped. “But I measured.”

“I don’t care if you used a level,” Amanda replied. “They’re not going up.”

Wolf crossed her arms. “You don’t like any of them?”

Amanda softened, reaching out to rest a hand against Wolf’s chest. “I like you. I don’t like living in a shrine to predation.”

Wolf considered this, eyes flicking around the room. “It feels… empty.”

Amanda nodded. “It’s supposed to. Empty means calm. Means nothing is trying to prove it belongs more than we do.”

Wolf mulled that over, then sighed. “Okay. What if—” she brightened slightly “—just one? In the hallway. For protection.”

Amanda smiled, fond and patient. “We already have protection.”

Wolf blinked. “We do?”

Amanda kissed her, slow and certain. “You.”

Wolf flushed, then grumbled. “Still think the opossum would add character.”

Amanda laughed, looping her arm through Wolf’s. “Come on. Help me hang the lights instead.”

Wolf let herself be dragged toward the toolbox, casting one last wistful look at the pile of heads.

They didn’t go up.

But later—much later—Amanda found a small carved wolf tucked discreetly onto a shelf between two books. Not watching. Just present.

She left it there. 
=======================================
Wolf didn’t know what Valentine’s Day was supposed to look like anymore.

She knew what it used to be—faded posters, pink hearts, plastic promises that love could be scheduled and sold. The wasteland had burned all that away. But Amanda had mentioned it once, casually, while sorting supplies.

“Pre-war thing,” she’d said. “Didn’t matter much. Still doesn’t.”

Wolf had filed that away immediately.

Which meant, of course, that it mattered.

Amanda woke to quiet.

Not the uneasy quiet of danger, but the deliberate kind—the kind Wolf made when she was trying very hard. The house smelled different, too. Less sugar. More… earth.

“Amanda,” Wolf said softly.

She stood in the doorway, hair loosely tied back, jacket shrugged on despite the warmth. In her hands was a small box made from scavenged tin, edges sanded smooth.

“I know this day isn’t… yours,” Wolf said, eyes flicking away briefly. “But I wanted to do something that felt like you.”

Amanda sat up, suddenly alert. “Wolf…”

Wolf crossed the room and set the box in Amanda’s lap. Inside were three things:

A glass bottle of perfectly purified water—cold, untouched, sealed tight.
A carefully wrapped stack of Nuka-Cola candies, sorted by flavor, the blues and cherries arranged with almost military precision.
And beneath them, a thin strip of metal etched by hand.

Amanda lifted it gently.

It was a skyline—clean lines, minimalist, unmistakably inspired by pre-war modern architecture. No teeth. No claws. Just structure and calm.

“For your shelf,” Wolf said. “I tried mounting a head but—” She stopped herself, huffing. “I didn’t.”

Amanda laughed, soft and stunned, then covered her mouth as emotion caught up with her.

“You remembered,” she whispered.

Wolf shrugged, suddenly shy. “You like things that don’t ask anything of you. That just are. I thought… maybe I could be like that too.”

Amanda stood and pulled Wolf into a hug before she could finish. Wolf stiffened for half a second, then melted into it, arms wrapping tight, grounding.

“This is perfect,” Amanda said into her shoulder. “No one’s ever… seen me like this before.”

Wolf pressed a kiss into Amanda’s hair. “I see you every day.”

They shared the candy later—Amanda eating most of it, Wolf stealing one piece just to prove she could. Wolf ate dog food by the window, Amanda sipping water beside her, legs tangled together like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Outside, the wasteland didn’t care what day it was.

Inside, Wolf had made something gentle.

And for Amanda, that was love enough.

=========================================
Wolf didn’t even try to hide it.

She came back to CAMP grinning—wide, sharp, barely-contained—boots barely touching the ground as she crossed the perimeter. Amanda looked up from her terminal and knew immediately something was wrong.

Or wonderful.

“Pack your things,” Wolf said. “Not everything. Just the good flashlight. And the shoes you don’t mind getting wet.”

Amanda narrowed her eyes. “You sound like someone who found trouble.”

“I found pre-war excess,” Wolf corrected. “The kind that survived.”
The farmhouse looked ordinary enough—white paint long peeled away, porch sagging, a rusted mailbox listing a name that didn’t matter anymore. Amanda would have written it off instantly if Wolf hadn’t been vibrating beside her like a feral child who’d discovered fire.

“Here,” Wolf said, dragging her through the front door and straight past the empty rooms. “Basement.”

The stairs creaked ominously as they descended. Amanda’s skepticism lasted exactly three more steps.

The wall at the bottom wasn’t a wall at all.

It slid aside with a groan of old hydraulics, revealing a corridor lit by emergency lights that still, somehow, glowed soft and gold.

Amanda stopped dead.

“Oh,” she breathed.

Wolf beamed. “I knew you’d like it.

Wolf had oversold it.

Not intentionally. Just… enthusiastically.

Amanda realized this the moment they pushed open the farmhouse basement door and dust cascaded down like the building was sighing in relief they’d finally come back to finish the job.

“This,” Amanda said carefully, shining her flashlight down the steps, “is not what I would call structurally reassuring.”

Wolf was already halfway down, practically bouncing. “It gets better. And worse. But mostly better.”

The bunker entrance wasn’t hidden so much as forgotten. A collapsed wall, a half-buried blast door, concrete cracked like a ribcage punched inward. Water dripped somewhere in the dark. The air smelled like rust, mold, and old power.

Amanda stepped inside and immediately had to duck under a fallen beam.

“…you’re smiling,” she said.

Wolf was grinning like she’d found buried treasure. “Look at the scale of it.”

The golf course stretched out beyond the rubble, absurd even in decay. Artificial turf peeled up in places, earth bleeding through where the ceiling had partially collapsed. One fairway had completely caved in, dropping into a sinkhole that vanished into darkness.

Amanda stared. “Someone built this underground while the world was dying.”

“Yeah,” Wolf said. “And then they stayed.”

They followed the humming.

The generator room was worse.

The door hung crooked, metal warped outward like something had tried very hard to leave. Inside, the lights flickered weakly, casting long shadows over massive pre-war machinery that still—against all logic—ran.

And beside it stood the former owner.

A glowing one.

Its skin shone sickly green, sloughing in places, eyes milky but aware. It turned slowly when they entered, mouth working soundlessly before a wet, rasping growl crawled out of its throat.

Amanda froze.

Wolf moved instantly.

She put herself between Amanda and the ghoul without even looking back, posture low, feral, territorial. “Hey,” she murmured. “Easy.”

The glowing one lunged.

The fight was brutal and fast. The confined space amplified every sound—bone cracking, metal ringing, radiation sizzling in the air. Wolf took a hit she shouldn’t have, staggered, snarled, and tore into it with knife and rage until the thing finally collapsed beside the generator it had worshipped for decades.

Silence fell heavy.

Amanda’s hands shook as the adrenaline caught up. She stepped forward, pressed both palms into Wolf’s chest, checking. “You’re bleeding.”

Wolf waved it off, breathing hard. “Worth it.”

Amanda stared at the corpse, then at the generator, still humming faithfully. “He kept it running,” she said softly. “All this time.”

Wolf nodded. “Guess this place was his pack.”

They stood there, the weight of it settling.

Later, sitting on a broken poolside bench while dust drifted through a cracked ceiling, Amanda looked around at the filth, the collapse, the danger.

“This place is a disaster,” she said.

Wolf braced herself.

Amanda continued, “It’s unsafe. Irradiated. Morally horrifying. Structurally compromised.”

Wolf sighed. “Yeah.”

“And,” Amanda added, resting her head briefly against Wolf’s shoulder, “it could be incredible. With work.”

Wolf’s head snapped toward her. “You mean—”

“I mean,” Amanda said, steady and calm, “you found something that can be made into a home. Not because it’s perfect. Because it survived.”

Wolf’s grin came back, smaller this time. Realer.

“See?” she said. “Better and worse.”

Amanda smiled despite herself. “You’re not allowed to surprise me with glowing ghouls anymore.”

Wolf shrugged. “No promises.”

They left the bunker as dusk settled over the ruined farmhouse, both already planning—Wolf thinking in defenses and paths, Amanda thinking in cleanup and systems.

Dirty. Broken. Dangerous.

But theirs, maybe.

And in the wasteland, that was how all the good places started.

===============================================
Wolf came back at dusk, boots caked with mud and ash, jacket torn at the sleeve, the sharp metallic tang of irradiated rain clinging to her skin. She didn’t announce herself. She never did. She just crossed the perimeter, counted the traps, and let her shoulders finally drop when she saw the warm glow of the CAMP lights.

Amanda was waiting.

Not pacing. Not worried in the frantic way she used to be. Just there, sleeves rolled up, kettle already steaming on the cooktop like this had been scheduled by instinct.

“You’re late,” Amanda said mildly.

Wolf huffed. “Found a collapsed tunnel. Didn’t like it. It didn’t like me either.”

Amanda took in the scrapes, the grime, the way Wolf was already halfway dissociating into “still alive, deal with it later.” She stepped closer and rested a hand at Wolf’s lower back, grounding.

“Sit,” she said.

Wolf obeyed without thinking.

The bath was nothing fancy — a salvaged metal tub, purified water warmed just enough, a bar of soap Amanda had traded for weeks ago because it didn’t smell like antiseptic or blood. Amanda poured carefully, testing the temperature with her wrist before motioning Wolf forward.

“You don’t have to,” Wolf muttered, shrugging out of her jacket anyway.

“I know,” Amanda said. “I want to.”

That quiet certainty still got to her.

Wolf lowered herself into the tub with a long exhale she didn’t realize she’d been holding since morning. Amanda knelt behind her, gentle hands working soap into tangled hair, fingers slow and deliberate.

“You always come back like you’re still braced for something,” Amanda said softly.

Wolf leaned forward, forearms resting on the rim. “Habit.”

Amanda rinsed the grime from her shoulders, tracing scars she knew by heart. “You don’t have to be on guard here.”

Wolf didn’t answer, but her breathing slowed.

This — this was when Amanda felt most like herself. Not commanding, not hiding behind structure, but tending. Keeping the home warm. Making sure the person who went out into the ruins came back to something steady.

Somewhere along the way, she’d stopped fighting the role. Campwife, caretaker, whatever the wasteland wanted to call it. It wasn’t submission. It was choice.

Wolf reached back blindly, found Amanda’s wrist, held it there. Not asking. Just anchoring.

“Did you eat?” Wolf asked.

Amanda smiled. “Candy and water.”

Wolf snorted. “I brought back jerky.”

“Then I’ll pretend,” Amanda said, rinsing the last of the soap away. “Like always.”

They stayed like that until the water cooled — Wolf clean, loose-limbed, safe; Amanda steady, present, needed.

Outside, Appalachia was still dangerous.

Inside, the CAMP held.

And for tonight, that was enough.
